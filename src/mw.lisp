  (format t
          "Usage:
--mw-help
    Emit the usage and quit.
--mw-version-string
    Emit the version number of the CL-MW library and quit.
--mw-master
    Run the executable in Master Mode. Required if --mw-slave is not set and
    must be first on the command line.
--mw-slave
    Run the executable in Slave Mode. Required if --mw-master is not set and
    must be first on the command line.
--mw-master-host <ip address or hostname>
    When in Master Mode, it is the interface (either the hostname or
    the ip address) to which the master should bind and is emitted to
    the resource file if any such file is written.
    When in Slave Mode, it is the hostname, or ip address, to which
    the slave process should connect and get work.
--mw-master-port <port>
    To which port should the slave connect for work.
--mw-max-write-buffer-size <size in bytes>
    How big the network writing buffer should be before rejecting the write.
--mw-max-read-buffer-size <size in bytes>
    How big the network reading buffer should be before rejecting the read.
--mw-client-timeout <seconds>
    How many seconds should the master wait for a client to respond
    when the master is expecting a response.
--mw-audit-file <filename>
    A file in which the audit trail of the process is stored.
--mw-resource-file <filename>
    When in master mode:
      Describes the resources needed by the master for a higher level batch
      system to honor.
      The information written into this file is:
        The timestamp of when the file was written.
        The member-id of the master group.
        The update-interval of when this file will be written again.
        How many slave processes are needed by the master.
        The full path to the slave executable.
        The complete arguments to the slave in order for it to connect to
          the currently running master process which produced this file.
      This file is emitted in a lisp friendly format.
    When in slave mode:
      Determine the master-host and master-port to which the slave should
      connect by reading it from the resource file.
      The ordering of this command line option in relation to --mw-master-host
      and --mw-master-port is important. If --mw-master-host and/or
      --mw-master-port are specified before this argument then the
      resource file will overwrite the command line specification, and vice
      versa. If the resource file does not exist, then this is ignored in
      deference to --mw-master-host and --mw-master-port.
--mw-resource-file-update-interval <seconds>
    How many seconds in between updating the resource file with current
      information.
--mw-slave-task-group <positive integer>
    How many tasks should be grouped into a network packet being sent to
    a slave process. If the packet is larger than the maximum size of
    the read buffer of the slave, the slave will abort the read. Defaults
    to 1.
--mw-slave-result-group <positive integer>>
    How many completed results should be grouped into a network packet
    being sent from the slave to the master. If the packet is larger than the
    maximum size of the read buffer for the master, then the master will
    abort the connection to the slave. Defaults to 1.
--mw-member-id <string>
    This is a token which must match between the slave and the master. It is
    used to unsecurely identify a working group pf masters and slave. In a
    harsh environment with many masters and slaves going up and down, this
    acts as a simple sanity check that the correct slaves are connected to the
    correct master process. Default is the string \"default-member-id\".
--mw-slave-executable <path to executable>
    This specifies the absolute path to a slave executable. It is used
    when writing the resource file only.
